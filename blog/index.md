# Research Blog

I am a 3rd year PhD student in computer science at UC Santa Cruz. This blog is an (updated) attempt
to keep my writings in a public format (in the style of [Frank McSherry's
Blog](https://github.com/frankmcsherry/blog)). I will also try to maintain portions that are
significant in [mdbook format](https://rust-lang-nursery.github.io/mdBook/).

This README may not always be kept up to date, but I'll do my best :)
