Education
---------

2018-202X (does anyone really know)
:   **Ph.D., Computer Science**; UC, Santa Cruz

    Declarative Programmable Storage
    Advisor: Peter Alvaro

2007-2013
:   **B.S.-M.S., Computer Science**; Cal Poly, San Luis Obispo

    Clustering for Microbial Source Tracking

Work Experience
---------------

April 2015 - September 2018
:   **Personalis (Menlo Park, CA)**; Bioinformatics Analyst/Engineer

    Content, Pipeline, and Annotation Team

    Software development using primarily bash, python, SQL server, and MySQL.

    * Process and load annotation data into internal database systems. Types
      of annotation data include:
        * Reference assemblies
        * Allele and genotype frequencies
        * Gene to phenotype relationships
        * Small variant to phenotype relationships

    * Maintain internal tools for annotating small variants called by
      internal variant calling pipeline. Internal tools leverage 3rd party
      tools, such as snpEff.

    * Contribute to data management including:
        * data model design
        * stored procedure and query development
        * system architecture
        * develop data reporting system


August 2013 - April 2015
:   **Workday (Pleasanton, CA)**; Associate Software Development Engineer

    OMS Performance - Scalability Engineering
    Software development using primarily java, bash, MySQL, and hive.

    * Handled occasional performance regressions in operations.
    * Contributed to testing platform for performance and regression tests.
    * Performed some load testing of internal high-volume test tenants using
      LoadRunner.
    * Performed some data analysis of application usage data to help
      understand and triage performance issues.
