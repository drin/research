### About Me

I am currently a 3rd year PhD student in computer science ([CMPS][ucsc-phd-reqs]) at UC Santa Cruz.
My advisor is Peter Alvaro and I am primarily working with Peter Alvaro, Carlos Maltzahn, and
Jeff LeFevre on [declarative programmable storage][project-programmability], but I am also interested
in bioinformatics, distributed systems, and data management systems.

# Research

Here, I am hoping to publish my thoughts and research, as well as keep track of readings. I mostly
failed to write the content I wanted to last year, but will hopefully be able to commit more
time this year.

### Theorycrafting

I always thought [theorycrafting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theorycraft) was a fun word for a fun idea.
This section indexes blog posts, or series of blog posts, for something research-y or project-based where I
am ultimately "theorycrafting" (assuming life is a game and/or simulation). Some of the series below may also
include short and sweet (or not sweet) side projects.

This will be the least complete of all the sections on this website as I have found it is hard for me to take
various thoughts to completion in a blog format. I tend to keep these thoughts in notes or just in my head,
though I am trying to improve on this.

### Readings

This section will include paper reviews, paper presentation materials, and anything else that seems
relatively similar in spirit. I will try to eventually organize the reading sections below in a way
that it can be easy to tell what I have read, what I thought about it, and maybe gather some fun
statistics on my reading progress.


#### &middot; [Reading Queue](readings/reading-queue.md)
I think it would be nice to keep a public reading queue. Maybe others can make recommendations, or at least
get a sense of what papers I think should be read for anyone in my field.


#### Readings by Research Group

| Principal Investigators (PIs)    | Group                                               |
| -------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------- |
| Josh Stuart                      | [Stuart Lab][group-jstuart]                         |
| Peter Alvaro and Carlos Maltzahn | [Declarative Programmable Storage][group-declstore] |


#### [Readings by Date][reading-by-date]

An index of reading reviews by date. This will be updated periodically, when I need to
procrastinate important work or when I feel like it should be updated.
