### About Me

I am currently a 5th year PhD student in computer science ([CMPS][web-phdreqs]) at UC Santa Cruz,
advised by [Peter Alvaro][person-palvaro]. My research interest is in the intersection of data
management systems, storage systems, programming languages, and bioinformatics. I primarily work
with Peter Alvaro, Carlos Maltzahn, and Jeff LeFevre; but, I also work with Josh Stuart and Philip
Kufeldt (Seagate). Additionally, I am trying to contribute to the [Apache Arrow][community-arrow]
and [Human Cell Atlas][community-hca] communities.


### [Research](research/README.md)

I am working on research to leverage computational storage drives (CSDs) for
bioinformatics (and, more generally, scientific computing workloads). To make my research
easier to build on or use, I have separated parts of it into separate projects which I
will try to make individually useful.


##### Projects

**[MSG Express](research/msg-express/overview.md).** A domain-specific data management
system for single-cell gene expression data ("gene expression"). This should be a library
usable by application developers for interacting with gene expression data and for storing
and managing that data in a computational storage system.

**Skytether.** A computational storage system that is spiritually an extension of
SkyhookDM for computational storage devices (CSx). The version I'm building can stand on
its own, but will largely be a prototype platform for research.

**Mohair.** A library for translating query plans into and from substrait as decomposable
query plans.

####  Readings

[&middot; Reading Log.](readings/reading-log.md) Here is a list of my past readings and relevant
thoughts. If I go back and re-read a paper, I'll simply append to the entry for that reading so
that changes in opinion can be referenced (for my own curiosity).


[&middot; Reading Queue.](readings/reading-queue.md) Here is a list of materials I plan on reading.
