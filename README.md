### About Me

I am currently a 4th year PhD student in computer science ([CMPS][web-phdreqs]) at UC Santa Cruz,
advised by [Peter Alvaro][person-palvaro]. My research interest is in the intersection of data
management systems, storage systems, programming languages, and bioinformatics. I primarily work
with Peter Alvaro, Carlos Maltzahn, and Jeff LeFevre; but, I also work with Josh Stuart and Philip
Kufeldt (Seagate). Additionally, I am trying to contribute to the [Apache Arrow][community-arrow]
and [Human Cell Atlas][community-hca] communities.


### [Research](research/README.md)

**SkySQL.** Blog posts under the `SkySQL` topic discuss the use of the "Arrow compute engine"
(project name is still TBD) in order to express queries to skytether. I am attempting to work
towards specifying a query plan that can be expressed and executed by Arrow, but that can be
optimized and arbitrarily split.

####  Readings

[&middot; Reading Log.](readings/reading-log.md) Here is a list of my past readings and relevant
thoughts. If I go back and re-read a paper, I'll simply append to the entry for that reading so
that changes in opinion can be referenced (for my own curiosity).


[&middot; Reading Queue.](readings/reading-queue.md) Here is a list of materials I plan on reading.
