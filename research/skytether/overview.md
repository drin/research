# Skytether

Originally, I was trying to determine a reasonable name for my project that was relevant to
`SkyhookDM`. My work was initially imagined as something that would sit on top of--or live as an
extension of--`SkyhookDM`. For this reason, I have been calling my project `Skytether` (meant to
have the connotation of a particular part of a [skyhook][wiki-skyhook]). For a first name, it
seemed reasonable.

Now, beyond names, most of the code that I have written is meant to eventually integrate with
[SkyhookDM][web-skyhookdm], providing the necessary functionality to be able to delegate some
processing to computational devices that a computational storage server may be using. Similarly to
how `SkyhookDM` brings tabular data management to an existing storage system, `Ceph`, I imagine
that `Skytether` would bring the use of **computational storage devices** to an existing
**computational storage system**, `SkyhookDM`.
