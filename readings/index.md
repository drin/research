# Research Readings

This area contains reviews and lists of various readings that I have or plan to do. A large portion
of these are for various graduate courses at UC Santa Cruz at some point, but I will also be adding
readings I find along the way. Eventually, this area will represent useful slices of research
relevant to my interests (hopefully).
